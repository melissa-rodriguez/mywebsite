    <h2>Autonomous Logistics Robot</h2>
    <p>This goal of this project is to design and develop an autonomous robot to function as a basic
        warehousing system, commonly referred to as a logistics robot. The "warehouse" will consist of 
        a flat surface with predefined and marked routes connecting a "docking area" to three "storage areas"
        and a "distribution area". 
        <br> <br>
        Mission: Robot leaves a parked position in the docking area, travels to the distribution area to retrieve
        a package, and convey it to one of three pre-determined storage areas according to the package type. The 
        packages are all cubes of different colors and sizes, where each size has a unique color. 
        <br><br>
        This project is currently in progress, you can follow the prototyping and development process <a class = "link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D99JTI8R66_GwBpWcue-n3vsT6oxDIpL?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>.

    <h2>Eye Controlled Music & Art System</h2>
    <p>There are children at <a class = "link" href="https://www.marycariola.org/" target = "_blank">Mary Cariola Children's Center</a> who are non-verbal, have limited use of hands and feet,
        and can only move via wheelchairs. Many of these students participate in an art and music class as a part of
        their therapy. These are some of the purest forms of self expression; however, because of their limitations,
        many of the artistic choices are made by the class clinicians. Decisions that range from choice of colors to creating
        the music on instruments such as the drums or tambourine. 
        <br> <br>
        The goal of this project is to design a transport device that will house an eye-tracking system. The system will use the eye 
        movement of the students to create art and music with the help of an application. This will provide the kids with a higher 
        level of independence in creating their own artistic and musical masterpieces.
