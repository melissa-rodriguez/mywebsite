    <h2>Autonomous Logistics Robot</h2>
    <p>This goal of this project is to desisgn and develop an autonomous robot to function as a basic
        warehousing system, commonly refered to as a logistics robot. The "warehouse" will consist of 
        a flat surface with predefined and marked routes connecting a "docking area" to three "storage areas"
        and a "distribution area". 
        <br> <br>
        Mission: Robot leaves a parked position in the docking area, travels to the distribution area to retrieve
        a package, and convey it to one of three pre-determined storage areas according to the package type. The 
        packages are all cubes of different colors and sizes, where each size has a unique color. 
        <br><br>
        This project is currently in progress, you can follow the prototyping and development process here.
