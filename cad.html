        <p> It's been about 3 years since I've used CREO Parametric as a 3D modeling tool so I was a little rusty at the beginning
            of this project. Gyroscope was a fun way to incorporate revolves, the pattern tool, different constraint connections, and a servo motor analysis.
            Initially, I had some trouble with the servo motor analysis; applying a gravity component would make the Gyroscope
            fall flat on it's side and rotate in a way that was not physically possible. My mistake was forgetting to define materials for all parts.
            An animation of the assembly in motion is coming soon.  </p>

        <p> The slider game was a fun project to explore some in depth functionality of CREO such as repeating a part instead of creating 9 seperate
            tile parts. This project also taught me about defining behaviors of parts by enabaling push upon collision to prevent the tiles from 
             overlapping when moving them around the base. I used the boolean operation to cut the lighting bolt out of the tiles. The hardest part of
            this model was deciding on the picture of the puzzle. How could I <span style="font-weight: 600;">not</span> make it the Electric Slide(r)?!
            This is the first project I've made that will be brought to life. I'll be using a laser cutter
            to create this wooden slider game!

        <p class = "date">Oct. 2019</p>
        <p> The Geneva Cam was an opportunity for me to learn how to create relations between dimensions on both a part and assembly level. I had difficulty grasping 
            this concept in the beginning since creating features required referencing other features. After a while, I unsderstood how to assign relations while making
            features or sketches. The most critical feature than can be changed within relations is the number of slots on the wheel. When creating the assembly, I had 
            go into some of the parts to adjust the dimensions to allow for some clearence to prevent interference.

        <p class = "date">Oct. 2019</p>
        <p> I was experimenting with flexible modeling for this project. I played around with adjusting the resolution of the surface to manipulate the model in different
            ways. In the beginning, it was difficult to select the surface an manipulate it without changing the oposite side. I had to take things slow and carefully adjust
            the sections I wanted until the sphere looked pumpkin-like. To create the stem, I used the style tool to create a curve that resembled a pumpkin stem and created a 
            sweep along the curve. The shape of the sweep is a star, I thought it resembled a stem more than a perfect circle. I used a skull image to create the sketch that 
            would become the face of the Jack-O-Lantern.

        <p class = "date">Nov. 2019</p>
        <p> The endplate was modeled after a drawing. I was trying to incorporate the tolerance in the drawing into the 3D model. Then I re-drew the drawing on creo to get some
            practice working with the GD&T tools.

        <p class = "date">Sept. 2019</p>
        <p> To recreate a spirograph, I started by modeling a spur gear and ring gear. I used the relations tool once again to create appropriate dimensions for the gears; this was 
            also helpful if I wanted to change the number of teeth on the gears. I used an online <a class = "link" href="http://www.beyondmech.com/pro-e/cad-topic-27.html" target = "_blank">tutorial</a> 
            as a guide to create the spur gear. In order to show the path of the "pen" that moves as the spur gear travels along the ring gear, I created a datum point pattern on the spur
            gear and ran a mechanism analysis on a given point. I played around with the number of teeth the ring gear and spur gear needed to have to create different patterns.
