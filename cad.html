        <p> It's been about 3 years since I've used CREO Parametric as a 3D modeling tool so I was a little rusty at the beginning
            of this project. Gyroscope was a fun way to incorporate revolves, the pattern tool, different constraint connections, and a servo motor analysis.
            Initially, I had some trouble with the servo motor analysis; applying a gravity component would make the Gyroscope
            fall flat on it's side and rotate in a way that was not physically possible. My mistake was forgetting to define materials for all parts.
            An animation of the assembly in motion is coming soon.  </p>

        <p> The slider game was a fun project to explore some in depth functionality of CREO such as repeating a part instead of creating 9 seperate
            tile parts. This project also taught me about defining behaviors of parts by enabaling push upon collision to prevent the tiles from 
             overlapping when moving them around the base. I used the boolean operation to cut the lighting bolt out of the tiles. The hardest part of
            this model was deciding on the picture of the puzzle. How could I <span style="font-weight: 600;">not</span> make it the Electric Slide(r)?!
            This is the first project I've made that will be brought to life. I'll be using a laser cutter
            to create this wooden slider game!
